<h2>Custom Themes</h2>

<h3>CURRENT STATUS</h3>
<p>
  You may have used our components and realized that you currently cannot
  customize the component styles. We understand that this is a huge blocker for
  everyone and we do apologize for the inconvenience. Please note that We have
  every intention of making our component library the most simplistic and
  intuitive for designers and developers alike.
</p>
<p>
  While we're still in Alpha, we will be experiementing with theme customizers
  and exposing new ways to access the theme properties of Svelteit components.
  Thank you for your patience!
